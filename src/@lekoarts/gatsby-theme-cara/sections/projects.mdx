  I created an e-commerce site where anyone from our university can buy and sell
  IUT T-shirts, hoodies, jackets and other accessories. I used Node.js, Express,
  PostgreSQL database for backend development. The website has been deployed in
  Heroku. Github link : https://github.com/fahimmahmood/iutstore

  Student Information System of our University is on private IP. So, we need to
  be connected to our University LAN to access our result, courses and personal
  data. To tackle that, I have created my own version of Student Management
  System which is also deployed in Heroku. I have implemented Restful API using
  Node.js, Express, Mongodb database and followed MVC architecture. Github link

  Weather web-app which can query weather information about any cities of the
  world. I have used Vanilla JS and public weather API to create this.
